Notes
=====

-   Reviewing the proposals for FedCM → see:
 [<u>https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/tree/main/proposals</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/tree/main/proposals)

    -   A walk through was shared by Sam:

    -   Origin of Items being reviewed:

        -   were bundled for post-launch (of the API) to derisk the
         launch

        -   Numerical ordering roughly ordered by maturity level of item

            -   Some implemented in Chrome behind a flag

    -   Discussion around Item1
     [<u>https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/tree/main/proposals</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/tree/main/proposals)

        -   the challenge of blocking/not blocking 3rd party cookies
         exhibits a timing attack on things - difference in
         behaviour between Firefox and Chrome revealed the
         challenge

        -   SamG: seeking insight/agreement from firefox team on the
         topic (item 1 in the list)

            -   Item filed and in the queue affirmed by BenV

-   [<u>The Multi-IdP
 API</u>](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/blob/main/proposals/multi-idp-api.md)

    -   IdP sign-in Status API and the Multi-IdP support API are the
     bigger in the sense of collaboration, security, privacy etc

    -   

-   The iFrame API will be shipping with M110.

-   [The Login Hint
 API](https://github.com/fedidcg/FedCM/blob/main/proposals/login-hint.md)

    -   For the browser, not the IdP? → Affirmed by SamG

    -   Caution on the names as OIDC has prior art/existence that may be
     confused/overloaded/different semantic meaning than this use
     of it(Chris’ comments as scribe :) )

    -   SamG: semantically the same

    -   

-   Q: HeatherF: seeking clarity/insight on how and/or when these items
 are going into production (for Chrome)?

    -   SamG: [<u>blink-dev mailing
     list</u>](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev)
     is the place to signal things (url?) then there’s a process
     things go through (is this better explained in a URL location?
     Not going to write it out here ..

        -   [<u>https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev</u>](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev)

        -   [<u>https://www.chromium.org/blink/launching-features/</u>](https://www.chromium.org/blink/launching-features/)

        -   HeatherF: seeking insight how progress can be signalled to
         this group/more widely

            -   SamG\[action?\]: yes, can work with Heather on this
             aspect..

-   Observations from attendees

    -   Group desires some improved instrumentation on the process
     things going through the process in the various components
     (Matrix page beneficial? Knowing it will be tough to keep
     current of course &lt;scribes comments&gt;)

    -   Discussion around how work on the items occurs and the order,
     and presence along the related release pipelines

-   Items 6 and below are what the FedCM Chrome team is working on
 (correct if I have this wrong)

    -   SamG walked throught the items

        -   further down the list is less specified and described some
         of the process

        -   Counter proposals are a stronger/more informative way to
         offer alternative ways to migrate things

-   Discussion on mechanics/process on the items shown

    -   Achim offered some observations on challenges on how to advance
     the issues/resolution them (Achim, scribe has paraphrased
     this)

Comments on the Multiple IdP challenge

-   SamG:Is the path on this topic the ‘least punishing’ to all but
 still is impactful – seeking position on things (link for this ?)

    -   Nicolas, BenV commented on it being in the queue and will
     assemble the PR for multiple idP spec

    -   SamG

ChrisP’s comments echo some of Achim’s on mechanics and that others may
be mis-interpretting how work / things are progressing and what the
outputs are.

-   AOB

    -   Ben V will be out on 12+ weeks

        -   Seeking help for PR on fetch spec

        -   SamG: can help out here
